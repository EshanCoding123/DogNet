HELLO EVERYONE + ANIMAL HACKS COMMITEE!

My name is Eshan, and I am a proud dog owner and rising senior in high school. I have designed a web-application called "DogNet". This app works in conjunction with GPS tracking. My idea with this app was to create a "dog network" of sorts, where you could see your own dogs through GPS trackers and other owner's dogs. I also wanted to mainly show the characteristics of each dog on the map, so that people are aware of whether dogs are friendly or not. This can prevent a lot of bad interactions between dog owners who have unfriendly dogs and unsuspecting people. It can also show other people if their dog is a service animal, and even help people with dog allergies avoid other dogs. 

For example, my dog Hunter looks to be a friendly Golden Retriever. However, he also tends to occasionally jump on other people. There were a few times where he jumped on others out of pure excitement, and if my app were there, people could see my dog's tendencies in advance and avoid interacting with him. 

Dogs cannot be registered without a GPS. You can still see other dogs publicly, but you cannot register any dogs if you do not have a GPS and a DEVICE_ID and location is being posted to that DEVICE_ID.

Here are the key features of the software:
- GPS device is assigned a unique ID that must be entered on registration for dog
- Your phone device is mainly used as the GPS. In the future, custom GPS's will be distributed
- Dogs can be registered, removed, edited, and deleted
- Dogs can be displayed publicly to other owners (this shows whether owners should approach the dog or stay away from them)
- Dogs can also be displayed solely to the owner by turning off a checkbox in the dog registration
- Public location of your dog is not shown when you are in your house for privacy
- MongoDB Atlas stores login and account info along with each dog and each location/public location

To register a GPS, you must use a phone as a GPS for now. The main idea is that some type of GPS device posts location to the server.
